			<br><br>
		</p>

		<p class="b">
			This scene is from an episode of the <a href="https://knifepointhorror.libsyn.com/">Knifepoint Horror
				podcast</a>, used with permission from (as well as my eternal gratitude to) the incomparable Soren
			Narnia--the author, creator, and main voice actor of Knifepoint Horror.<br><br>

			The scene is freshly scored with original music throughout. The original release of this scene had no
			backing
			track to it, as is the original author's typical style.<br><br>

			In addition to the musical composition, some cleaning of the original vocal track was done in order to match
			the
			qualities of both the music and the narration.<br><br>

			The original scene can be found here in the episode <a
				href="https://knifepointhorror.libsyn.com/circles">"Circles"</a> as well as on most podcast apps and
			services.

			<br><br>
		</p>

		<p class="b">
			This is a scene from <i>The Cosmonaut</i>, a film released under a Creative Commons license. Visually, the
			scene
			was kept as originally released. Musically, the scene has been entirely re-scored, using some of the
			original
			spoken dialogue as well as public domain sounds from NASA.<br><br>

			All of the film's original footage and sound, as well as the launch sounds taken from NASA, are available on
			archive.org. <BR><BR>

			The scene as originally scored can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/eSHSoo7uD6I&t=3967s">here</a>.

	 <p class="b">
Sintel is the third “open movie” made by Blender and released under Creative Commons. I’ve kept the original voice over, sound effects and voice acting, but I’ve written my own score for this scene. The original scene can be viewed along with the rest of the movie <a href="https://youtu.be/eRsGyueVLvQ&t=152s">here</a> (link goes directly to this scene). 
<br> <br>

			Symphonic pieces

			<br> <br>
		</p>

		<p class="b">
			This piece attempts to tell a story through only music. It's a love story, and I was pretty happy with how
			it
			came out. Two themes, represented most often by specific instruments, fall in love, grow together, grow
			apart,
			and ultimately reconcile. The themes weave together and perform calls-and-responses as they interact to tell
			the
			story. <br> <br>

			The idea itself is I guess, sort of inspired by, or at least derived from <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. Pieces
			like
			<i>Peter and the Wolf</i> and Holst's <I>The Planets</I> suite are most often referred to as program music
			or
			programmatic music. They are also occasionally known as symphonic poems.<br><br>

			However, Holst described <i>The Planets</i> as a "series of mood pictures," which is the description I think
			I
			like best.
