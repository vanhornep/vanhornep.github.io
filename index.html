		<br><br>
	</p>
	
	<p class="b"> 
		This scene is from an episode of the <a href="https://knifepointhorror.libsyn.com/">Knifepoint Horror podcast</a>, used with permission from (as well as my eternal gratitude to) the incomparable Soren Narnia--the author, creator, and main voice actor of Knifepoint Horror.<br><br>
	
		The scene is freshly scored with original music throughout. The original release of this scene had no backing track to it, as is the original author's typical style.<br><br>

		In addition to the musical composition, some cleaning of the original vocal track was done in order to match the qualities of both the music and the narration.<br><br>
	
		The original scene can be found here in the episode <a href="https://knifepointhorror.libsyn.com/circles">"Circles"</a> as well as on most podcast apps and services.

		<br><br>
	</p>

	<p class="b">
		This is a scene from <i>The Cosmonaut</i>, a film released under a Creative Commons license. Visually, the scene was kept as originally released. Musically, the scene has been entirely re-scored, using some of the original spoken dialogue as well as public domain sounds from NASA.<br><br>

		All of the film's original footage and sound, as well as the launch sounds taken from NASA, are available on archive.org. <BR><BR>
	
		The scene as originally scored can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/eSHSoo7uD6I&t=3967s">here</a>.

		<br> <br>
	</p>

	<p class="b">
		This piece attempts to tell a story through only music. It's a love story, and I was pretty happy with how it came out. Two themes, represented most often by specific instruments, fall in love, grow together, grow apart, and ultimately reconcile. The themes weave together and perform calls-and-responses as they interact to tell the story. <br> <br>

		The idea itself is I guess, sort of inspired by, or at least derived from <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. Pieces like <i>Peter and the Wolf</i> and Holst's <I>The Planets</I> suite are most often referred to as program music or programmatic music. They are also occasionally known as symphonic poems.<br><br>
	
		However, Holst described <i>The Planets</i> as a "series of mood pictures," which is the description I think I like best.
