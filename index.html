<p class="b"> This is a scene from an episode of the <a href="https://knifepointhorror.libsyn.com/">Knifepoint Horror podcast</a>, with added backing music by me, used with permission from (as well as my eternal gratitude to) the incomparable Soren Narnia--the author, creator, and main voice actor of Knifepoint Horror. The original scene can be found here in the episode <a href="https://knifepointhorror.libsyn.com/circles">"Circles"</a> as well as on most podcast apps and services.

<a href="https://youtu.be/yFfiHUQRwWE">The Cosmonaut (2013) Launch Scene </a><br><br></p>
<p class="b">
This is a scene from <i>The Cosmonaut</i>, a film released under a Creative Commons license. The scene was kept as originally released, and I musically re-scored it and used some of the original spoken dialogue as well as public domain sounds from NASA, both of which are available on archive.org. The scene as originally scored can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/eSHSoo7uD6I&t=3967s">here</a>.

<a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/oQM2c1bFEB1SP5eU7">The First Vision</a>

<br> <br></p>
<p class="b">
This is a piece that I wrote, attempting to tell a story through only music. It's a love story, and I was pretty happy with how it came out. Two themes, represented most often by specific instruments, fall in love, grow together, grow apart, and ultimately reconcile. The themes weave together and perform calls-and-responses as they interact to tell the story. <br> <br>

The idea itself is I guess, sort of inspired by, or at least derived from <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. Holtz described his suite, <i>The Planets</i>, as a "series of mood pictures." I think I like that description the best, but pieces like this are also referred to as program music or programmatic music, as well as symphonic poems.
