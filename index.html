	Inspired by composer Murray Gold, whose work I know mainly from <i>Doctor Who</i>, I decided to write a group of 
	themes for specific characters. I had an AI art program create inages for four characters: a heroine, a sidekick, 
	a love interest, and a villain. <br><br>

	I then developed a theme for each character, and I wrote a suite that comprises all four themes. 
	It starts out with a movement that is reminiscent of a marching band or drum corps opener, 
	followed by a a mixture of waltzes and ballad pieces. All are tonally and thematically similar, 
	sticking mostly to the key of D major. <br><br>

			This piece attempts to tell a story through only music. It's a love story, and I was pretty happy with how it came out. Two themes, represented most often by specific instruments, fall in love, grow together, grow apart, and ultimately reconcile. The themes weave together and perform calls-and-responses as they interact to tell the story. <br> <br>

			The idea itself is I guess, sort of inspired by, or at least derived from <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. Pieces like
			<i>Peter and the Wolf</i> and Holst's <I>The Planets</I> suite are most often referred to as program music or
			programmatic music. They are also occasionally known as symphonic poems.<br><br>

			However, Holst described <i>The Planets</i> as a "series of mood pictures," which is the description I think
			I like best.<br><br>

			This scene is from an episode of the <a href="https://knifepointhorror.libsyn.com/">Knifepoint Horror podcast</a>, used with permission from (as well as my eternal gratitude to) the incomparable Soren Narnia--the author, creator, and main voice actor of Knifepoint Horror.<br><br>
			The scene is freshly scored with original music throughout. The original release of this scene had no backing track to it, as is the original author's typical style.<br><br>
			In addition to the musical composition, some minor cleaning of the original vocal track was done in order to match the qualities of both the music and the narration.<br><br>
