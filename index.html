	<p class="c">A suite of variations on <a href="https://www.flipvanhorne.com/themes.html">four character</a> themes.
	</p><p class="b">	Inspired by composer Murray Gold, whose work I know mainly from <i>Doctor Who</i>, I decided to write a group of 
		themes for specific characters. I had an AI art program create inages for four characters: a heroine, a sidekick, 
		a love interest, and a villain. <br><br>
		I then developed a theme for each character, and I wrote a suite that comprises all four themes. 
		It starts out with a movement that is reminiscent of a marching band or drum corps opener, 
		followed by a a mixture of waltzes and ballad pieces. All are tonally and thematically similar, 
		sticking mostly to the key of D major. <br><br>

	<p class="c">A love story, told through music.
	</p><p class="b">This piece attempts to tell a story through only music. It's a love story, and I was pretty happy with 
		how it came out. Two themes, represented most often by specific instruments, fall in love, grow together, grow apart, 
		and ultimately reconcile. The themes weave together and perform calls-and-responses as they interact to tell the story. 
		<br> <br>
		The idea itself is I guess, sort of inspired by, or at least derived from <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. Pieces like
		<i>Peter and the Wolf</i> and Holst's <i>The Planets</i> suite are most often referred to as program music or
		programmatic music. They are also occasionally known as symphonic poems.<br><br>
		However, Holst described <i>The Planets</i> as a "series of mood pictures," which is the description I think
		I like best.<br><br>

	</p><p class="b">This is a swing-style jazz piece that's been bopping around in my head for a while now. It's written mostly using the F blues scale. <br><br>
		Honestly, I was in Jazz Band as a kid, and every so often I get into a Jazz/Swing mood and follow the Miles/Coltrane/Dizzy/Duke/et al. rabbit hole down a ways. This is the result of my most recent foray.
